/// Which build of OneAlarm this is, in words, on screen.

/// Added 2026-08-16 after the third round in a row where the first question was "is the code you are
/// running the code I pushed", and there was no way to answer it. Alex reported a feature not
/// working, I reasoned about why, and twice the answer was that his phone was running a build from
/// before the fix. Reasoning about a build you cannot identify is the same mistake as reasoning
/// about a response you have not printed.
///
/// Bumped by hand in the same commit as any change worth testing. A stamp that lags is worse than
/// none, because it answers the question wrongly and confidently.

    /// Date, then what landed. Short enough for a footer, specific enough to match against a commit.

    /// One line, and it is the thing to go and test. Anything longer gets skipped.

It now says plainly when the schedule is at the right time but switched off, and what to tap. If it stays off after a Set all alarms with no one time change, tell me: that means the app cannot switch it back on and the whole switch off feature has to go."
