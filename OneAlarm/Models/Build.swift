/// Added 2026-08-16 after the third round in a row where the first question was "is the code you are
/// running the code I pushed", and there was no way to answer it. Alex reported a feature not
/// working, I reasoned about why, and twice the answer was that his phone was running a build from
/// before the fix. Reasoning about a build you cannot identify is the same mistake as reasoning
/// about a response you have not printed.
///
/// Bumped by hand in the same commit as any change worth testing. A stamp that lags is worse than
/// none, because it answers the question wrongly and confidently.
